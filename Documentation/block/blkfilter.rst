Block Device Filtering Mechanism
================================

The block device filtering mechanism is an API that allows to attach block
device filters.  Block device filters allow perform additional processing
for I/O units.

Introduction
============

The idea of handling I/O units on block devices is not new.  Back in the
2.6 kernel, there was an undocumented possibility of handling I/O units
by substituting the make_request_fn() function, which belonged to the
request_queue structure.  But no kernel module used this feature, and it
was eliminated in the 5.10 kernel.

The block device filtering mechanism returns the ability to handle I/O units.
It is possible to safely attach one filter to a block device "on the fly"
without changing the structure of block devices.

Design
======

The block device filtering mechanism provides functions for attaching and
detaching the filter.  The filter is a structure with a reference counter
and callback functions.

The submit_bio_cb() callback function is called for each I/O unit for a block
device, providing I/O unit filtering.  Depending on the result of filtering
the I/O unit, it can either be passed for subsequent processing by the block
layer, or skipped.

The link counter allows to control the filter lifetime.  When the reference
count is reduced to zero, the detach_cb() callback function is called to
release the filter.  This allows the filter to be released when the block
device is disconnected.
