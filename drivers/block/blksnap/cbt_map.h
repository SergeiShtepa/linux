/**
 * struct cbt_map - The table of changes for a block device.
 *
 * @locker:
 *	Locking for atomic modification of structure members.
 * @blk_size_shift:
 *	The power of 2 used to specify the change tracking block size.
 * @blk_count:
 *	The number of change tracking blocks.
 * @device_capacity:
 *	The actual capacity of the device.
 * @read_map:
 *	A table of changes available for reading. This is the table that can
 *	be read after taking a snapshot.
 * @write_map:
 *	The current table for tracking changes.
 * @snap_number_active:
 *	The current sequential number of changes. This is the number that is written to
 *	the current table when the block data changes.
 * @snap_number_previous:
 *	The previous sequential number of changes. This number is used to identify the
 *	blocks that were changed between the penultimate snapshot and the last snapshot.
 * @generation_id:
 *	UUID of the generation of changes.
 * @is_corrupted:
 *	A flag that the change tracking data is no longer reliable.
 *
 * The change block tracking map is a byte table. Each byte stores the
 * sequential number of changes for one block. To determine which blocks have changed
 * since the previous snapshot with the change number 4, it is enough to
 * find all bytes with the number more than 4.
 *
 * Since one byte is allocated to track changes in one block, the change
 * table is created again at the 255th snapshot. At the same time, a new
 * unique generation identifier is generated. Tracking changes is
 * possible only for tables of the same generation.
 *
 * There are two tables on the change block tracking map. One is
 * available for reading, and the other is available for writing. At the moment of taking
 * a snapshot, the tables are synchronized. The user's process, when
 * calling the corresponding ioctl, can read the readable table.
 * At the same time, the change tracking mechanism continues to work with
 * the writable table.
 *
 * To provide the ability to mount a snapshot image as writeable, it is
 * possible to make changes to both of these tables simultaneously.
