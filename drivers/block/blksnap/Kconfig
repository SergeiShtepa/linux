	  Designed for creating backups for block devices. Snapshots are
	  temporary and are released when backup is completed. Change block
	  tracking allows to create incremental or differential backups.

	  Theoretical asynchronous algorithm for processing I/O units should
	  have higher performance. However, an attempt to confirm this on test
	  runs did not bring any results.
