/**
 * struct diff_area - Describes the difference area for one original device.
 *
 * @kref:
 *	The reference counter allows to manage the lifetime of an object.
 * @orig_bdev:
 *	A pointer to the structure of an opened block device.
 * @diff_storage:
 *	Pointer to difference storage for storing difference data.
 * @chunk_shift:
 *	Power of 2 used to specify the chunk size. This allows to set different
 *	chunk sizes for huge and small block devices.
 * @chunk_count:
 *	Count of chunks. The number of chunks into which the block device
 *	is divided.
 * @chunk_map:
 *	A map of chunks.
 * @store_queue_lock:
 *	This spinlock guarantees consistency of the linked lists of chunks
 *	queue.
 * @store_queue:
 *	The queue of chunks waiting to be stored to the difference storage.
 * @store_queue_count:
 *	The number of chunks in the store queue.
 * @store_queue_work:
 *	The workqueue work item. This worker limits the number of chunks
 *	that store their data in RAM.
 * @free_diff_buffers_lock:
 *	This spinlock guarantees consistency of the linked lists of
 *	free difference buffers.
 * @free_diff_buffers:
 *	Linked list of free difference buffers allows to reduce the number
 *	of buffer allocation and release operations.
 * @physical_blksz:
 *	The physical block size for the snapshot image is equal to the
 *	physical block size of the original device.
 * @logical_blksz:
 *	The logical block size for the snapshot image is equal to the
 *	logical block size of the original device.
 * @free_diff_buffers_count:
 *	The number of free difference buffers in the linked list.
 * @corrupt_flag:
 *	The flag is set if an error occurred in the operation of the data
 *	saving mechanism in the diff area. In this case, an error will be
 *	generated when reading from the snapshot image.
 * @error_code:
 *	The error code that caused the snapshot to be corrupted.
 * @tracker:
 *	Back pointer to the tracker for this diff_area
 *
 * The &struct diff_area is created for each block device in the snapshot.
 * It is used to save the differences between the original block device and
 * the snapshot image. That is, when writing data to the original device,
 * the differences are copied as chunks to the difference storage.
 * Reading and writing from the snapshot image is also performed using
 * &struct diff_area.
 *
 * The xarray has a limit on the maximum size. This can be especially
 * noticeable on 32-bit systems. This creates a limit in the size of
 * supported disks.
 *
 * For example, for a 256 TiB disk with a block size of 65536 bytes, the
 * number of elements in the chunk map will be equal to 2 with a power of 32.
 * Therefore, the number of chunks into which the block device is divided is
 * limited.
 *
 * The store queue allows to postpone the operation of storing a chunks data
 * to the difference storage and perform it later in the worker thread.
 *
 * The linked list of difference buffers allows to have a certain number of
 * "hot" buffers. This allows to reduce the number of allocations and releases
 * of memory.
